## Hi, I'm Minas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [UC Berkeley Center For Cosmological Physics](https://bccp.berkeley.edu/) and [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). I'm interested in astronomical data science, machine learning, Bayesian inference, and open-source scientific software development.
