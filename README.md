## Hi, I'm Minas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [UC Berkeley Center For Cosmological Physics](https://bccp.berkeley.edu/) and [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). I'm interested in astronomical data science, machine learning, Bayesian inference, and open-source scientific software development.

I received my PhD in Astrophysics in 2022 from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where my thesis pioneered novel methods for scalable and gradient-free Bayesian inference with applications in astronomy. Prior to my doctorate, I obtained a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and a Bachelor's degree in Physics from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://www.auth.gr/en/).
